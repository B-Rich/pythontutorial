A Beginner's Python Tutorial
============================

Here lies my beloved Python tutorial. It has been published, source and all, so
that it might *finally* be fully corrected/updated/relevant.

While I have previously guarded 'ownership' of the tutorial (and, according to
the LICENSE, I am still the copyright holder), the fact is that the wider
software community can be a much better custodian of its content than can I.

I still intend on hosting this tutorial on http://sthurlow.com/python/ - it
ain't going anywhere. Re-skins/corrections/expansions might all be uploaded. It
is currently MIT (see LICENSE.mit) and Creative Commons Attribution Australia
(see LICENSE.cc-by) licensed - take your pick.

So. It has come to this. Fork me, biatches!
